    <div class="intro">
      <p>Generally there exists two opposing mentalities in how to address the impending climate change crisis: technoscientific and regenerative/restorative. A technoscientific approach that is being proposed and actively pursued is geoengineering.
        A regenerative/restorative approach that roots itself in the environmental movement is permaculture.</p><br></br>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="definition">Geoengineering</span> refers to large-scale schemes for intervention in the earthâ€™s oceans, soils and atmosphere with the aim of reducing the effects of climate change. Geoengineering proposals generally fall into
          two categories: removing carbon from the atmosphere, or shielding Earth from solar radiation.</li>
        <br></br>
        <li><span class="definition">Permaculture</span> is an approach to land management and philosphy that adopts arrangements observed in flourishing natural econsystems. It includes a set of design principles derived using whole systems
          thinking.
          It uses these principles in fields such as regneratuve agriculture, rewilding, and community resilience.</li>
